D83F (aka- KAMER)
[Speed] = 0000/0001 for left/right
[Speed 2]*
     -1st nybble = vertical speed (maxes out around 40)
     -2nd nybble = horizontal speed (starts glitching around 50)

These look a lot like one of the Shutter2 enemies, but acts like Kamer.  Horizontal speed is usually set to 00.
