DFBF (aka- RSTONE)
Speed: 0X00
0000 = fall and roll to the right
0100 = fall and roll to the left
0200 = fall, bounce once, then crumble
Other values work, but seem to be repeats of these 3, or a very similar effect

Speed2: XXYY
XX = Number of pixels above the enemy to place the rock and how far it will fall
YY = (I think) how close samus can come horizontally before the rock falls

Orientation: 00XX
XX = (I think) how close samus can come vertically before the rock falls.

Example: Place the rock on the very bottom left of a room so that the bottom of the rock touches the floor and give it these values: 
Speed: 0000 
Speed2: 8040 
Orientation: 0080. 
The rock will be placed 8 tiles above the place you see it in SMILE and activate upon samus coming within both 4 tiles horizontally and 8 tiles vertically, where it will then fall 8 tiles, and roll to the right until it hits a wall, where it will crumble.
