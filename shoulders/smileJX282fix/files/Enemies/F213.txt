F213 (aka- GAMET)
[Speed 2] AABB
     AA = Velocity
     BB = Proximity

5 Pieces... All must be included.  Speed 2 includes velocity for all 5, but only the first piece has a proximity value.  Proximity is only figured in relation to the first piece (ie- you can be near another piece without activating it).
